## Usage

Navigate to the [Website](https://nifty-pizza-hunt.herokuapp.com/) to view all current pizzas or create a new one if none exist. To create a new pizza, the user is prompted for their name, the pizza name, size, and a list of predefined toppings as well as the option for adding additional custom toppings. Once a pizza is created, users can start a discussion about it via comments and replies.
